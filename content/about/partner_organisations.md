  <h6>Pathogens Portal</h6>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.pathogensportal.org/" target="_blank">Pathogens Portal</a>, maintained by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (<a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">EMBL-EBI</a>) and partners, was launched in July 2023. The Pathogens Portal is a resource for e.g. researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. Its aim is  to facilitate access to the latest and most comprehensive datasets on pathogens. The COVID-19 pandemic put a  spotlight on the importance of data sharing and for focused access to relevant datasets. Therefore, the Pathogens Portal was developed as a centralised platform for  data sharing and accessing data on key pathogens. These pathogens include both pathogens affecting humans and animals, and on vectors and hosts. Bringing together data from a number of sources, and linking data contributes to a better understand Pathogen ÃÅs Biology. Funded through five European Union projects funded under the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe programmes: <a href="https://recodid.eu/" target="_blank">RECODID</a>, <a href="https://www.veo-europe.eu/" target="_blank">VEO</a>, <a href="https://www.eosc-life.eu/" target="_blank">EOSC-Life</a>, <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge" target="_blank">CONVERGE</a> and <a href="https://by-covid.org/" target="_blank">BY-COVID</a>. Moving forward, national nodes of the Pathogens Portal will be added, the Swedish Pathogens Portal is the first to launch in Sept 2023. An overview of other national nodes <a href="/other_national_portals/">can be found here</a>.</p>
