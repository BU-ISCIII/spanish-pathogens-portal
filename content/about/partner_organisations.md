  <h6>Pathogens Portal</h6>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.pathogensportal.org/" target="_blank">Pathogens Portal</a>, maintained by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (<a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">EMBL-EBI</a>) and partners, was launched in July 2023. The Pathogens Portal is a resource for e.g. researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. Its aim is  to facilitate access to the latest and most comprehensive datasets on pathogens. The COVID-19 pandemic put a  spotlight on the importance of data sharing and for focused access to relevant datasets. Therefore, the Pathogens Portal was developed as a centralised platform for  data sharing and accessing data on key pathogens. These pathogens include both pathogens affecting humans and animals, and on vectors and hosts. Bringing together data from a number of sources, and linking data contributes to a better understand Pathogen ́s Biology. Funded through five European Union projects funded under the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe programmes: <a href="https://recodid.eu/" target="_blank">RECODID</a>, <a href="https://www.veo-europe.eu/" target="_blank">VEO</a>, <a href="https://www.eosc-life.eu/" target="_blank">EOSC-Life</a>, <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge" target="_blank">CONVERGE</a> and <a href="https://by-covid.org/" target="_blank">BY-COVID</a>. Moving forward, national nodes of the Pathogens Portal will be added, the Swedish Pathogens Portal is the first to launch in Sept 2023. An overview of other national nodes <a href="/other_national_portals/">can be found here</a>.</p>

    <h6>Swedish Pathogens Portal</h6>
    <p>The Swedish Pathogens Portal provides information about available datasets, resources, tools, and services related to pandemic preparedness in Sweden.</p>
    <p>The Swedish Pathogens Portal is managed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and its collaborators, who created an open-source reference framework for national data portals. This framework combines Hugo for site generation, Bootstrap for layout and styling, DataTables for tabular content, and Vega/Vega-Lite and Plotly for interactive visualizations. All components used in the Swedish Portal are openly available under the MIT license on GitHub. The development of The Spanish Pathogens Portal has been inspired by the local node portals templage generated at <a href="https://scilifelab.se/data/" target="_blank">SciLifeLab</a> based on their <a href="https://www.pathogens.se/" target="_blank">Swedish Pathogens Portal</a>.</p>

    <h6>Swiss Pathogens Portal</h6>
    <p>The <a href="https://pathogensportal.ch/" target="_blank">Swiss Pathogens Portal</a> was developed to support researchers by serving as a one-stop resource for all Swiss pathogen data and projects, fostering collaboration and synergies through a dedicated forum for discussion, offering documentation and training materials on FAIR research data management—particularly for pathogen omics data—and highlighting Swiss resources that facilitate data sharing, access, analysis, and interpretation.</p>

    <h6>Norwegian Pathogens Portal</h6>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.pathogens.no/" target="_blank">Norwegian Pathogens Portal</a> provides information about available datasets, resources, tools, and services related to pandemic preparedness in Norway. The portal gives researchers, clinicians and policymakers access to an extensive collection of biomolecular data about pathogens. The Portal will also be the main access to the Norwegian Pathogen Data Hub which enables sharing pathogen data and their associated clinical/epidemiological metadata under controlled access.</p>
