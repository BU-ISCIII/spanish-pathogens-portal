## Background

**Influenza viruses** are major human respiratory pathogens responsible for **seasonal epidemics** and occasional **pandemics**, causing significant **morbidity**, **mortality**, and **healthcare burden** worldwide.

There are four types of influenza viruses (A, B, C, and D), but **types A and B** are the most relevant for human disease. Influenza A viruses are further classified by **hemagglutinin (HA)** and **neuraminidase (NA)** surface proteins (e.g., H1N1, H3N2), and are responsible for most severe outbreaks.

Because influenza viruses undergo **constant genetic changes** through **antigenic drift** and, occasionally, **antigenic shift**, **genomic surveillance** is crucial to:

- Monitor circulating **subtypes and clades**
- Detect **emerging variants** with pandemic potential
- Inform **vaccine strain selection**
- Identify **mutations** linked to antiviral resistance
