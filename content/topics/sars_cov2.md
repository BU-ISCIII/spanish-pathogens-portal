## Background

**SARS-CoV-2** is the novel coronavirus responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic, first identified in December 2019. As an RNA virus with high mutation rates, SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, leading to the emergence of new **variants** with potential implications for **transmissibility**, **disease severity**, and **vaccine effectiveness**.

Over the past years, genomic surveillance has been essential to:

- Track the spread of lineages and **variants of concern (VOCs)**
- Detect **recombinant strains** and **mutation hotspots**
- Inform public health responses and vaccine strategies

Despite a global decrease in case numbers, **SARS-CoV-2 remains a pathogen of interest** due to its continued evolution and potential for seasonal resurgences or variant-driven outbreaks.
