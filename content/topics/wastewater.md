This section includes dashboards and reports related to **wastewater-based genomic surveillance**, a powerful tool to monitor the presence and spread of **viruses and bacteria** in communities.

## Background

**Wastewater surveillance** involves the collection and analysis of sewage samples to detect the presence of pathogens, genetic material, or chemical indicators excreted by the population. It has proven especially useful in identifying **early signals of infectious disease outbreaks**, including **COVID-19**, **polio**, **norovirus**, and **antibiotic resistance genes**.

Because it captures data from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, wastewater monitoring provides a **non-invasive**, **cost-effective**, and **community-level** snapshot of population health.

**Why is it important?**

* Detects **early circulation** of pathogens before clinical cases rise.
* Monitors **community-level trends** in near real-time, regardless of healthcare-seeking behavior.
* Tracks **variants** and **resistance genes** across broad populations.
* Supports **public health response** by informing targeted interventions, resource allocation, and risk communication.
* Plays a critical role in **integrated disease surveillance systems**, especially in resource-limited settings.
