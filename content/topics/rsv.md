## Background

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but can lead to serious illness in infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. It is one of the leading causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children under one year of age worldwide.

Monitoring RSV through genomic surveillance provides essential information for public health responses, including early detection of outbreaks, identification of viral variants, and evaluation of vaccine and antiviral efficacy. Surveillance data support the development of prevention strategies, guide immunization efforts, and inform clinical management.
