This section includes dashboards and reports related to the genomic surveillance of **bacteria**, at this moment includes mainly **Antibioitc resistance**.

## Background

**Antibiotic resistance** occurs when bacteria evolve mechanisms to survive exposure to the drugs designed to kill them. This makes infections harder or sometimes impossible to treat, leading to longer illnesses, higher medical costs, and increased mortality.

The rise of **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)** is recognized as one of the greatest threats to global health, food security, and development. It compromises the effectiveness of treatments for common infectious diseases such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections.

**Why is it important?**

- Resistant infections cause **longer hospital stays**, **higher healthcare costs**, and **greater risk of death**.
- AMR can **spread rapidly** across countries and regions, especially in hospital and community settings.
- Without effective antibiotics, modern medicine—such as surgery, chemotherapy, or organ transplantation—would become significantly riskier.
- Surveillance of resistance trends is essential to guide **treatment guidelines**, **public health policies**, and **research priorities**.
