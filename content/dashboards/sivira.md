The Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance System (SiVIRA), which operates as a sentinel system, encompasses the surveillance of mild Acute Respiratory Infections (IRAs) in Primary Care and severe Acute Respiratory Infections (IRAG) in hospitals. This integrated respiratory surveillance system began operating in October 2020 and has been progressively consolidated at both the national and regional (Autonomous Communities) levels. SiVIRA has been established with the aim of being stable over time and capable of responding to the emergence of any new pathogens in the future.
