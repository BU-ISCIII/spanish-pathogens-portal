EU-WISH is a Joint Action under the EU4Health programme, which supports the policy priority of strengthening the European Union's capacity to prevent, prepare for and respond rapidly to serious cross-border health threats.

The focus of EU-WISH is to support activities to strengthen and improve national capacities for wastewater public health surveillance by enhancing knowledge exchange and sharing best practices based on scientific evidence.

To achieve this, a strong consortium (62 participants) has been established at European level to contribute to a vision and activities for wastewater monitoring not only at European but also at global level.
