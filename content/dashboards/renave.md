Regular updates on the COVID-19 situation in Spain, including geographic information and indicators on the evolution of the pandemic. The results presented in this dashboard are based on the reporting of COVID-19 cases to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE).

The National Public Health Surveillance Network (RENAVE) is an essential system for the detection and control of diseases in Spain, managed by the National Center for Epidemiology (CNE). Through RENAVE, data on communicable diseases and other public health risks are collected, analyzed, and disseminated, enabling a rapid and coordinated response at the national level. The service includes specific protocols for the surveillance of emerging diseases, healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), and other conditions of public health interest. These protocols ensure a standardized and effective approach to monitoring and responding to health risks.
