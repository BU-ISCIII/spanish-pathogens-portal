In line with the principles of _FAIR_ and _Open Science_, we encourage the reuse and recognition of material made available on the Spanish Pathogens Portal. On this page, you will find information about how to cite the portal when reusing and referencing the content. Please note that the information on the portal is updated continuously, therefore it is important to refer to specific versions (or to provide access dates) within citations.

To cite the portal website or underlying code in research publications, you can use:

**Spanish Pathogens Portal (_access date_), Institute of Health Carlos III, version (_version number_) from https://www.pathogensportal.isciii.es**

You will find the version number of the portal at the bottom of the footer on any page, or on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/node-pathogens-portal">pathogens-portal GitHub repository</a> under 'releases'.

All of the source code used on the website is available on GitHub. The code used to produce the website is available in our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/node-pathogens-portal">pathogens-portal repository</a>. All of the code that we have produced is available for reuse under an MIT licence.
